ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

-To set up the Student Enrollment System, first create a new database (enrollment) in phpMyAdmin and import the provided enrollment.sql file, which contains all necessary tables and sample data. Next, configure the db.php file with your database credentials so the PHP backend can connect properly. Then, place the project folder in your local server’s root directory (htdocs/cebuphp for XAMPP). Once loaded, the dashboard allows you to view, add, update, and delete students, programs, subjects, and manage enrollments dynamically, giving you a fully functional web-based enrollment management system.
